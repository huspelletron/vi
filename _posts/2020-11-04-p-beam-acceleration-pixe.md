12:20

- RF source on

- Set PRB VC to 3.5 kV

- Set EXT VC to 4 kV

 12:56

- Accelerator on at 1.3 MV

- beam current at FC01-1 ~ 100 nA

- beam current at FC02-1 ~52 nA (see attachment 1) and quite stable

13:10

- Adjust beam spot ~0.6x0.4 cm2

- Beam current at FCB1-1: ~9.7 nA ( see attachment 2)

- Start PIXE run 3143

- Start PIXE run 3142

13:53

- Start PIXE run 3144

- Beam current at FCB1-1 decrease to ~8.9 nA (see attachment 3)

15:49

- Run 3145 ended

- Beam current continue to decrease to ~7.2 nA

- Try to increase MV S2-1  a bit (from 1.7 to 1,9E-6 T) beam current increased to 8,4 nA and stable.

- Run 3146 started

17:09

- Run 3151 stop

- It's been 4 hours since accelerator started. It has been operated non-stop at Terminal voltage of 1.3 MV. No problem.

- Attachment 4: beam and accelerator condition

- Chiller temperature at 19.8 degree C. Room temperature 20 degree, humidity 60 %. All 4 air conditioners are On and set at 21 degree C.

- Keep running accelerator until ion source shut down.

17:27

- Accelerator off
